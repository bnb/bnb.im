There has been an [issue](https://github.com/nodejs/membership/issues/12) open for a while requesting applications for the two Individual Membership seats on the Board of Directors for Node.js. I had been carefully tracking conversations surrounding this issue, as the position greatly interests me.

I've discussed the position with several people who are important to me, and have decided to present myself as an applicant for one of the two seats.

# Who am I?
My name is Tierney Coren, but I go by **@bnb**, with the name `bitandbang`, on most sites. I am a student at [SUNY Polytechnic Institute](https://sunypoly.edu) in Central New York (CNY), studying as a Senior in the Communication and Information Design/Information Design and Technology accelerated BA/MA program. In my program, I am learning about design and design theory.

I am an employee of the Little Falls Public Library, a member of the MidYork library system in CNY, where I spend my time handling normal operations, helping the public with technical issues, and assist with the programs we run at the wherever the opportunity presents itself.

I have also been a studying developer for several years. For the majority of that I did not have a computer to write code on, so I could only attempt to learn code through reading bound books - I've amassed a collection of good front-end and a few back-end books that I continue to use on a daily basis. I've only recently been able to acquire a computer that I can write, code, and create on, but since then I've learned volumes more than I was able to with plain text, zero-input books.

# What is my Experience?
My main interest has been developer evangelism, since I already have decent writing skills. I can communicate effectively and concisely over the digital medium, and have thus been able to work well with evangelism groups.

I have done around a dozen written projects on open web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Node itself. Most recently, I was able to build several sites with the Node scaffolding framework Metalsmith, as a final project for my Information Design course, as a gift for someone close to me, and as a way to get my first OSS project, [metalsmith-barebones](https://github.com/bnb/metalsmith-barebones), out there. These projects were my first real taste of completing something with Node, and I've been left parched for more.

I have been submitting pull requests to the various projects I use and have an interest in for some time now, and feel very at-home on GitHub with the open-source community. I contributed a lot to the early development of the Node.js Evangelism WG, I helped out in some hopefully meaningful way in the Node.js Website WG, I've briefly contributed to the [Hoodie Editorial](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial) team, and I've sent several dozen pull requests to various projects that I have come in contact with or found interesting.

# Why should I be elected to the Node.js Board of Directors?

* **I want to see Node flourish to become the strongest programming platform**: All my time, attention, and energy as a board member would be geared toward ensuring that Node has a very bright future - one that leads it to become the strongest, friendliest, most stable programming platform in the world.
* **I have a focus on assisting in the creation of tools for developers to learn and adopt Node**: As a Node developer, my main interest is creating tools to help other developers. I want to help others learn Node, its frameworks, its libraries, and its APIs. Helping another developer learn a tool, write a line of code, or create a project gives me more satisfaction than anything else. I want nothing more than to help developers help themselves.
* **I do not have any secondary agendas**: I don't work for a company, so I have no ulterior motives to have Node take a certain path that will help me succeed. I don't make money from Node, so I am not wearing rose-colored glasses that will lead to me making choices that benefit myself. My only intentions are out in the open: I want to see Node succeed, and I will only propose, support, and rally behind decisions that will make this a reality.

# Do you have a question for me?
If you'd like to ask me a question about anything in this post, about myself, or about my role as a developer, feel free to send a mention to me on Twitter at [@bitadnbang](https://twitter.com/bitandbang), on Tent at [^bnb](https://cupcake.is/bnb), on via email at [`hello@bnb.im`](mailto:hello@bnb.im). I will respond as soon as I possibly can.
