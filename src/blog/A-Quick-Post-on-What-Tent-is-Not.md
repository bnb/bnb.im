What is [Tent](http://tent.io/)? I'm writing a post on that right now. I want to write a quick post on what Tent is _not_ before I publish that one, though.

# Tent is _not_...

## A Twitter clone

Tent can be used as a platform for microblogging, but don't limit it by thinking that microblogging is all Tent can do--it can do anything. The reason many people think that tent _is_ just a microblogging service is because the original MVP for Tent was a microblogging service--then, it was called Tent.is; now, it's a microblogging site with no official name, owned and operated by [Cupcake](https://cupcake.io/).

## A service

Tent isn't centralized with one company--it's a protocol, like HTTP, XML/RSS, and email. Tent is **developed** by a core set of people, who work for the non-profit which owns the Tent trademark. However, anybody can use Tent--you can help develop it, you can use it to build the next Facebook, Netflix, Google, and Dropbox, you can use it to build your home automation system, you can use it to build your personal development tools, and so on. Anybody can write software that implements it **as a protocol**, because it's not under one company's control. These are standards that haven't changed very much, if at all, in years--Tent is the next evolutionary protocol on the web. The second generation, if you will.

## A single app

Tent can be any app that exists on the web. Tent can be Facebook, Dribbble, Twitter, Dropbox, Yo, GitHub, DuckDuckGo, WordPress, phpBB, npm, or any other application you can conceive of which uses data. Tent is made of posts. Posts store data. Any kind of data.

## A "shared" data store

Users are expected to host their data--Tent isn't peer-to-peer (P2P). This doesn't mean that every Tent user has to either buy their own VPS or in-home server to keep their data. It just means that a users data is in a central place, their server, but that server can take many forms. It can be on a shared host, such as [Cupcake](https://cupcake.io/), on their own web server that runs a Tent server component (coming soon with [Flynn](https://flynn.io/) running a new, in-progress version of [tent-status](https://github.com/tent/tent-status)), or, yes, a 10 year old desktop PC running in your basement, using the same server components that a web server or dedicated server would run.

## Ready for everybody to use

Tent isn't close to its final form yet. There's still development to be done. That development will break things that developers develop and users use with each new version. Tent is certainly not anywhere near being good to use for the public--apps will break, data won't be accessible in the way they'd like it to be, and things won't go exactly as they planned. It's not a good idea to jump into Tent unless you're technical and willing to work with the updates as they come.

## Finale

Tent isn't everything it could be--yet. It's still in development, both programming-wise and concept-wise. My goal was to help clear up some misconceptions (okay, fine--nobody thought it was ready for everybody to use, but you get the idea) about Tent and help you understand what Tent _isn't_. Now you know that, you're reading to learn what Tent _is_.
