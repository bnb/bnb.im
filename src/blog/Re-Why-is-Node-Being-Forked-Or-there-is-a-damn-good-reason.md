# So why is Node being forked?

There's a damn good reason. The [original post](http://dtrejo.com/why-is-node-being-forked.html) by David Trejo seems standoffish and rude toward some of the top contributors to Node. While David doesn't take a strictly negative position, he says some negative things with regard to people who are trying to work out tough problems.


# Passive-agressive rhetoric.

> As a bystander to this, I hope that when the dust settles, Node's stability and progress have not been adversely affected.

Okay, it's nice of David to wish good luck in the end to Node. I don't think taking the innocent bystander role is something that most people would do, as it usually makes one helpless. Why not try to actually take an active role and help the Node community figure out where it's going?

I, for one, wish the best for the Node community. I think that this group of developers are trying to make the community and the software better for everyone's benefit, and I hope there is a positive end result that comes of their efforts.


# What to do...

> I know for a fact that all of these people have better things to do than forking node (running their businesses for example).

Okay, what the hell does this mean? Should they not be wasting their time trying to better the software that most, if not all, of their jobs depend on? Never mind the thousands of other developers and hundreds of thousands of users that depend on it.

Or, in contrast, is he supporting the forkers, saying they've got things that are more important, but they're being amazing and spending some of their time working on the software that most, if not all, of their jobs depend on?

It's really hard to tell, but judging by the tone of the rest of the article, I would guess the former is what was intended. I, on the other hand, think that what the newfound team is doing is quite noble--they have pure intentions, with the community's betterment in mind.


# The status quo is fine, there's never a reason to question it.

> I have no doubt that this whole thing is a big headache for everyone, and hopefully the headache goes away soon (they would not be forking if they didn't have good reasons).

This seems like a poorly worded wish of good luck. A big headache is an inherently negative thing, and suggests that the whole situation is a bad problem that the community wants to end as soon as possible. While it may be that the community wants to find a solution to the problem soon, as is the case with pretty much any issue, the way this is written makes it sound like the community wants a return to normalcy (to borrow a phrase from Warren G. Harding)--i.e. the way it was before. It seems this is exactly the opposite of what the community wants.

Personally, I think this is an issue that needs to be faced sooner rather than later--Node needs to be open if it is really going to succed. That means _fully_ open, not just sorta-kinda-mostly-half-partway open. The resolution that can come of this is that Joyent opens up Node all the way. The problem that can be brought up by this is that Joyent _doesn't_ open Node up all the way. The latter **will** lead to huge problems for Node, Joyent, and the community. Even if Joyent feels like it isn't in their prime interest in the present to open up, doing so will solve a lot of problems both now and in the future--some of which could lead to the ultimate downfall of Node. Absolutely _nobody_ wants that, right?

Additionally, the part in the parentheses seems to say that they probably have good reasons for forking Node, and contrasts with the previous part. This is, quite frankly, confusing as shit.

Taking what was written at face value, I couldn't agree more that there are extremely good reasons for the fork. These people, some of the top contributors to Node, know thier stuff and have the community's interests in mind. They're not going to lead us astray, given what they've proposed.


# Wait, what?

> (Fin.)

Bam! That's the end of David's post. What should the community do? Who should we be supporting? What can we expect? These questions are all left unanswered in his post. I'll take a shot at answering them, though.

The community should support Isaac, Bert, Fedor, Trevor, and Mikeal. As David points out, Node is currently under tight control. The direction of the project isn't being decided by the people who use it, but by a select group who have their own priorities.

As I see it, it's better for just about everybody if the project is ruled by objective, community focused committee than if it is ruled by a sole entity, with its own agenda. Isn't being open, free, and available what FOSS is about? It's hard to gaurantee that when ruled by few instead of by many.

As for what to expect, I imagine that there's going to be a pretty bad power struggle. I don't know any of the players in the issue very well, but that's how these things typically go. If, however, those currently in control of Node are truly focused on the communtiy and building the best software for everyone, I think we'll see that they take some time to deliberate on the issue. Then, they'll come back and help us transition to a new form of leadership of the project that will help benefit us all in the most basic issue: ensuring we have the best possible toolset we can have to write our software.
