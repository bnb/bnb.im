## You've probably heard of open-source. There's a good reason for that.

You've probably heard of open-source software (OSS, or just open-source). It's something that is extremely important to the JavaScript development community. You've also probably heard of this place called [GitHub](https://github.com/). If you don't know what open-source and GitHub are, here's a tl;dr synopsis:

## Open-sourcing your code

Okay, so why should I open-source my code? A simple answer is that you will help yourself by open-sourcing it, and you will help others by open-sourcing it.

#### How will I help myself?

You will help yourself because, if your work serves a common need or interesting purpose, others will use it. Undoubtedly there will be minor problems with it, or perhaps even major ones, and the others will report back to you about these problems in the code. This helps you make your code more perfect (though no script, file, or piece of code is ever perfect) and usable for yourself and for others.

#### How will I help others?

Your code likely does something. Whether it's the menial task of counting milliseconds or the feat of a working, massive social network, it's likely someone else has already tried to do it; it's almost a certainty that someone will try to do it in the future. When you open-source your code, you're making the task, or any derivatives of it, easier for others to complete. Why would you carve a new statue every time you wanted to look at one? Why do work again that's already been done? The answer: you shouldn't.

#### Why GitHub?

GitHub, as mentioned, is a platform where many, many developers are already sharing their open-source code. Most JavaScript developers have a GitHub account, and many use it frequently. It's a prime place to get your code seen, used, and audited. These are all extremely desirable things for a JavaScript project, and GitHub is the best chance you have to maximize the results of these actions.

## Conclusion

So, you know why open-sourcing is important. You know why GitHub is useful. I'd like to close by saying that these two things are what keep the JavaScript community alive. Your contributions to the greater community help every single developer, and every single user of their products. Open-sourcing your code is often the best thing you can do--and you're helping others by doing it.
