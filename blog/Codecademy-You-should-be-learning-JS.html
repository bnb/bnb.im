                      <p><a href="http://codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> is a website that helps you learn to code. They have several tracks that are all very high quality, but the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">JavaScript track</a> is their most well known. Rightfully so–it teaches you how to program with the language in a smart, fun, and engaging way.</p>
<h1 id="who-is-codecademy-for-">Who is Codecademy for?</h1>
<p>Let’s get this out of the way as soon as possible. I would say Codecademy has one main primary audience and two secondary audiences. Who are they?</p>
<h2 id="the-primary-audience">The primary audience</h2>
<p>The primary audience is people who are new to programming in general. JavaScript is a very popular first language to learn as it’s the scripting language of the web–formerly only on the front-end, but now both on the front- and back-end. The JavaScript track goes through and systematically teaches the user about the basics of programming such as strings, math, comments, and so on. So, it’s perfect for anybody who has never coded before and needs to be taught about all the different aspects of programming.</p>
<h2 id="the-secondary-audiences">The secondary audiences</h2>
<p>I would say that there are two secondary audiences. First, there are established programmers who want to learn JavaScript. There are many programmers of desktop languages who are coming to web programming and JavaScript. Codecademy is an excellent resource for this group, as they can briefly glance at the easier things, which they likely already know about, that are geared toward the primary audience and move on to the more complex things, such as prototype-based programming, inheritence, built-in functions, and so on, that are included in later parts of the course.</p>
<p>Second, there are intermediate level JavaScript programmers who need a refresher on a specific topic or method. These programmers can go to the Codecademy track, dig down until they find the lesson that they need, and implement what they found in their programs immediately.</p>
<h1 id="what-s-special-about-codecademy-">What’s special about Codecademy?</h1>
<p>Why should you learn at Codecademy instead of another source? Is Codecademy really the source for you?</p>
<h2 id="the-writing">The writing</h2>
<p>One thing that’s very nice about Codecademy is the way that the lessons are written–they’re easy to understand, have a playful tone, and let the user relax while they’re coding. This is very nice for the primary audience, as it’s easier for them to catch on and be comfortable with programming in JavaScript.</p>
<p>The upbeat, friendly writing style also takes the tone down a notch for all audiences from the normal seriousness of most tutorials and resources for learning JavaScript online. They’re normally very serious and paced, which is builds stress and makes the programming experience less than ideal. Codecademy does the opposite.</p>
<h2 id="sample-applications">Sample applications</h2>
<p>There’s another method that Codecademy uses to reinforce what you learn through the teaching phase of the track. That method is an implementation of the skills you learned in a sample application.</p>
<p>In the first part of each lesson, they teach you about specific funtionality. Then, in the second part, they guide you through creating an application using what you learned in the first part as well as what you’ve learned in previous lessons.</p>
<p>Some examples of sample applications are Choose Your Own Adventure games, a contact list, a Dragon slayer game, and an address book. These programs are written in pure JavaScript, utilizing the developer console for output, letting you focus on what matters.</p>
<h2 id="custom-lessons">Custom lessons</h2>
<p>There’s also the ability for any user to create their own lessons using Codecademy’s <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/create/creator#!/">course editor</a>. There are two reasons this is important.</p>
<p>First, if you’re not satisfied with what you’ve learned through the default JavaScript course, you can find many more courses that might suit your needs. There are many courses available at different skill levels, lending to a better learning environment for a wider audience.</p>
<p>Second, you can create your own courses. You might think of a way that a specific lesson could be done better, or think of a brand new topic to cover (like Node.js!). You could create a course that teaches whatever you want, and contribute not only to the Codecademy community, but also to the greater JavaScript community.</p>
<p>As a side note, I just want to mention that contributing to the community in any way is very important because it’s the way that new methodologies and ideas are developed to improve how we code. If nobody contributed to the greater JavaScript community with scripts, blog posts, and responses to mailing lists, there would be no development other than what the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/default.htm">ECMAScript team</a> thinks would be best for us.</p>
<h2 id="the-community">The community</h2>
<p>If you want to talk about JavaScript (or Python, Ruby, HTML, CSS, open source and so on), the Codecademy community is a very useful tool during or after you take the Codecademy JavaScript course. The community is very helpful, and will aid you in any problems that you may have with the course, specific lessons, or JavaScript in general. They’re extremely friendly and willing to collaborate on any projects that you might think of.</p>
<h2 id="javascript-api-lessons">JavaScript API Lessons</h2>
<p>So how do you put all this learning into use? Codecademy has a special area just for that. In the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/apis">API tracks</a> area, there are currently 11 tracks that teach you how to use JavaScript to implement an API for various sites. These sites include YouTube, Firebase, and SoundCloud. The API tracks are a really great way to put your skill to the test and learn how to actually use JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="gamification">Gamification</h2>
<p>One last special thing about Codecademy–they’ve done something special and added a special feature to thier site. They’ve <a href="http://gamification.org/wiki/Gamification">gamified</a> their courses so you can earn badges and points while you code. The system is quite fun, and it will likely motivate you to keep coding.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><a href="http://codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> is a really nifty website that’s useful if you want to learn JavaScript. If you’re just a beginner looking to learn, already an intermediate JS coder looking for a refresher, or an experienced programmer looking to learn JavaScript, check it out.</p>
