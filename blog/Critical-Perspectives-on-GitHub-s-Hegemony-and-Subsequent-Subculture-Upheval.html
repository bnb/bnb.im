                 <h1 id="what-is-github-">What is GitHub?</h1>
<p>GitHub is the self-defined “social coding” platform.  It is based on a version control system called git, but adds an entire platform with what boils down to team- and community-enabling features that can help projects develop thier code, fix bugs and propose feature requests, and grow from small, one-person side-projects to massive, co-operative project with thousands of contributors.</p>
<h1 id="how-do-the-critical-perspectives-of-digital-society-apply-to-github-as-a-social-network-">How do the critical perspectives of digital society apply to GitHub, as a social network?</h1>
<h2 id="hegemony">Hegemony</h2>
<p>GitHub had a sort of hegemony for the last three to four years. They had not made any improvements to public-facing features that would help open-source and free users (a very large amount of their public community) continue to grow their projects and develop communities.</p>
<p>The hegemonic view - an ideology asserted by the dominant class or group that becomes widely accepted and unquestioned - adopted by what seemed to me to be a vocal majority, was that they were busy working on GitHub Enterprise. They were too busy developing the thing that kept them afloat to continue to develop their forward-facing feature set.</p>
<p>For the past few years, this was generally accepted. As time went on, there was a growing disdain for the fact that there had been very few additions to the platform. More and more, there were individual voices that spoke up about the need for new features, but they were generally all but forgotten in under a week’s time.</p>
<h1 id="subculture">Subculture</h1>
<p>Finally, toward the end of 2015 and right at the beginning of 2016, there were more discussions being held about how frustrating the lack of response and the lack of action by GitHub was. It seemed the hegemonic ideology was being peeled away because some of the leaders of the Open-Source community were conversing and building off eachother on the need for new additions.</p>
<p>In early to mid-Janurary 2016, a <a href="https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github/commit/bc7a4f6bc78445905751061bf96f731edda14c25">large group of prolific and important Open-Source Software creators and maintainers</a> banded together and created an open letter to GitHub, entitled <a href="https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github">“Dear GitHub”</a>.</p>
<p>I would contend that this was the already-existing subculture of well-established developers that had two intents. First, they intended to assert their importance to GitHub’s public product - if they took their business elsewhere, to, say, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, GitHub could have a huge problem. Second, their intent was to call on the masses, the people who use the massive projects (but don’t necessarily have as many, as prolific, or as large of projects themselves), to join in the call for action and really get GitHub’s attention.</p>
<p>This is similar to many subculture movements, although I would pin it as more of a revolution by the subculture than a aversion to popular or “normal” culture. Dear GitHub was more than an appaeal - it was a critical demand of the users of GitHub, similar to what a subculture that has been opressed by a government does. Mind you, GitHub wasn’t an oppressive rigeme. However, the reaction was more of a requirement and demand of the subculture, something they needed in order to continue their loyalty and use of GitHub, insstead of the typical cultural disdain for the status quo and subsequent “radical” views and actions that something like Punk Rock adopted.</p>
<p>After the group of prolific developers published the Dear GitHub letter, the second intent that I contend they had was widely successful. To date, they have gathered over <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oGsg02jS-PnlIMJ3OlWIOEmhtG-udTwuDz_vsQPBHKs/edit#gid=290603204">1800 signatures on the Dear GitHub Signatures Google Spreadsheet</a>. This is a massive gathering of support for a programming issue - I’ve never seen this large of a group supporting an issue in the world of programming before.</p>
<p>About a month after Dear GitHub was published, GitHub officially responded to the Dear GitHub repository, which was added to the original letter. During that month, people were nervous and speculative about what was going to happen with it, if anything. Luckily, the response was more than positive - GitHub was outright apologetic about how they had handled the problem in the past, and made a deep commitment to work on the product in a way that benefitted the community.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how developers across languages, across platforms, across just about every boundary in the amazingly expansive world of development came together to form a single subculture from the absolutely vast number of their independent, often warring, subcultures, to join together. They did this to rise against the hegemony’s ideals and attempt make the world of Open-Source Software - almost exclusively hosted, developed, and maintained through GitHub and the features it provides - a better place for the entire community.</p>
