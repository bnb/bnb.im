                 <p>There has been an <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/membership/issues/12">issue</a> open for a while requesting applications for the two Individual Membership seats on the Board of Directors for Node.js. I had been carefully tracking conversations surrounding this issue, as the position greatly interests me.</p>
<p>I’ve discussed the position with several people who are important to me, and have decided to present myself as an applicant for one of the two seats.</p>
<h1 id="who-am-i-">Who am I?</h1>
<p>My name is Tierney Coren, but I go by <strong>@bnb</strong>, with the name <code>bitandbang</code>, on most sites. I am a student at <a href="https://sunypoly.edu">SUNY Polytechnic Institute</a> in Central New York (CNY), studying as a Senior in the Communication and Information Design/Information Design and Technology accelerated BA/MA program. In my program, I am learning about design and design theory.</p>
<p>I am an employee of the Little Falls Public Library, a member of the MidYork library system in CNY, where I spend my time handling normal operations, helping the public with technical issues, and assist with the programs we run at the wherever the opportunity presents itself.</p>
<p>I have also been a studying developer for several years. For the majority of that I did not have a computer to write code on, so I could only attempt to learn code through reading bound books - I’ve amassed a collection of good front-end and a few back-end books that I continue to use on a daily basis. I’ve only recently been able to acquire a computer that I can write, code, and create on, but since then I’ve learned volumes more than I was able to with plain text, zero-input books.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-my-experience-">What is my Experience?</h1>
<p>My main interest has been developer evangelism, since I already have decent writing skills. I can communicate effectively and concisely over the digital medium, and have thus been able to work well with evangelism groups.</p>
<p>I have done around a dozen written projects on open web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Node itself. Most recently, I was able to build several sites with the Node scaffolding framework Metalsmith, as a final project for my Information Design course, as a gift for someone close to me, and as a way to get my first OSS project, <a href="https://github.com/bnb/metalsmith-barebones">metalsmith-barebones</a>, out there. These projects were my first real taste of completing something with Node, and I’ve been left parched for more.</p>
<p>I have been submitting pull requests to the various projects I use and have an interest in for some time now, and feel very at-home on GitHub with the open-source community. I contributed a lot to the early development of the Node.js Evangelism WG, I helped out in some hopefully meaningful way in the Node.js Website WG, I’ve briefly contributed to the <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial">Hoodie Editorial</a> team, and I’ve sent several dozen pull requests to various projects that I have come in contact with or found interesting.</p>
<h1 id="why-should-i-be-elected-to-the-node-js-board-of-directors-">Why should I be elected to the Node.js Board of Directors?</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>I want to see Node flourish to become the strongest programming platform</strong>: All my time, attention, and energy as a board member would be geared toward ensuring that Node has a very bright future - one that leads it to become the strongest, friendliest, most stable programming platform in the world.</li>
<li><strong>I have a focus on assisting in the creation of tools for developers to learn and adopt Node</strong>: As a Node developer, my main interest is creating tools to help other developers. I want to help others learn Node, its frameworks, its libraries, and its APIs. Helping another developer learn a tool, write a line of code, or create a project gives me more satisfaction than anything else. I want nothing more than to help developers help themselves.</li>
<li><strong>I do not have any secondary agendas</strong>: I don’t work for a company, so I have no ulterior motives to have Node take a certain path that will help me succeed. I don’t make money from Node, so I am not wearing rose-colored glasses that will lead to me making choices that benefit myself. My only intentions are out in the open: I want to see Node succeed, and I will only propose, support, and rally behind decisions that will make this a reality.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="do-you-have-a-question-for-me-">Do you have a question for me?</h1>
<p>If you’d like to ask me a question about anything in this post, about myself, or about my role as a developer, feel free to send a mention to me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/bitandbang">@bitadnbang</a>, on Tent at <a href="https://cupcake.is/bnb">^bnb</a>, on via email at <a href="mailto:hello@bnb.im"><code>hello@bnb.im</code></a>. I will respond as soon as I possibly can.</p>
