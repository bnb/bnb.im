JavaScript is wonderful. I know I'm always keen to hear what's new in JS or related technologies. Podcasts on the topic are an excellent way to have a good time while learning about JS.

Below is a list of my favorite podcasts on JS in no particular order. You should check a few of them out to see which ones you like; there's always at least one gem-of-a-podcast for everybody. Have you found yours?

### [The JavaScript Show](http://javascriptshow.com/)

The JavaScript Show is a podcast that covers a lot of JS-related news. The hosts talk about a variety of topics within JS; it is an excellent way to get JS news.

### [JavaScript Jabber](http://javascriptjabber.com/)

JavaScript Jabber is an extremely active and well-loved podcast. The crew focuses mainly on one topic per podcast, which is an interesting and beneficial format for a code podcast.

### [Changelog](http://thechangelog.com/)

Changelog is a member-supported blog that also has a podcast. While it's not solely about JavaScript, the topic comes up frequently enough to be added here. Excellent podcast and excellent community.

### [Build Podcast](http://build-podcast.com/)

The Build Podcast, like Changelog, isn't completely focused on JavaScript, but JS is discussed frequently enough. Like Jabber, the show focuses mainly on one topic per episode in a short, digestible format.

### [NodeUp](http://nodeup.com/)

NodeUp is the go-to podcast for Node discussion. They have intelligent discussion on the various topics that Node encompasses, with various JS teams that the hosts interview. Highly recommended.

### [Ember Watch Podcast List](http://emberwatch.com/podcasts.html)

While not a specific podcast, this site links to various episodes of podcasts that are on the topic of Ember. A very interesting idea for a website, as well as a very useful one.
