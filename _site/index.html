        <description class="post-list-description">A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to attend TC39, the ECMA technical committee that defines the ECMAScript specification, for the first time. As a first-timer, the experience wasn't what I expected and I want to share what it was like being there. I'd like to share that experience with y'all ðŸ’– <a href="/posts/my-first-experience-attending-tc39/" class="post-list-read-more">Continue reading</a></description><article>

        <description class="post-list-description">On Friday, I was working on a <a href="https://github.com/bnb/step-by-step-express-workshop">workshop-ified version</a> of <a href="https://github.com/bnb/step-by-step-express">Step by Step Express</a> for <a href="http://flawlesshacks.com/">Flawless Hacks</a> in Brooklyn.<br>
<br>
In the workshop-ified version, I've modified each step so there is an <code>app.js</code> and an <code>app.complete.js</code> so that attendees could start with a clean slate from the previous step and know what they're aiming for to complete in the step that they're working on. <a href="/posts/using-npx-and-npm-scripts-to-reduce-the-burden-of-developer-tools/" class="post-list-read-more">Continue reading</a></description><article>

        <description class="post-list-description">This week, we saw the release of Node.js v12, the next Node.js release line that will become LTS. I wanted to go through the various posts that went out and the changelog and condense the information into an easily consumable digest of what's new in Node.js v12.x to share with everyone. ðŸ’– <a href="/posts/the-awesome-features-that-just-landed-with-node-js-v12/" class="post-list-read-more">Continue reading</a></description><article>

        <description class="post-list-description">Recently, I've been working a lot more with GitHub Actions - both writing actions and creating CI pipelines for projects.

        <description class="post-list-description">Today, npm has shipped automation tokens ðŸŽ‰<br>
<br>
Previously, if you wanted to automatically publish an npm module from CI/CD you had a choice - have 2FA turned off and allow publishing via a token <strong>or</strong> have 2FA turned on and build a custom tool to allow you to input a 2FA code when your CI/CD is trying to publish. <a href="/posts/securely-automating-npm-publish-with-the-new-npm-automation-tokens/" class="post-list-read-more">Continue reading</a></description><article>

        <description class="post-list-description">With the recent <a href="https://github.blog/2021-02-02-npm-7-is-now-generally-available/">release of npm@7</a>, we've gotten a few neat new features in npm.<br>
<br>
One of the ones that I imagine can go under the radar for most folks is the <code>npm diff</code> command. It's a relatively... advanced command that has immense potential utility. <a href="/posts/the-new-npm-diff-command/" class="post-list-read-more">Continue reading</a></description><article>

        <description class="post-list-description">Having been a part of the Node.js project since the io.js 1.0 announcement, one of the things I've grown extremely familiar with is how untouched Markdown documents that are supposed to provide a foundation can rot over time. <a href="/posts/markdown-link-checking-in-github-with-actions/" class="post-list-read-more">Continue reading</a></description><article>

        <description class="post-list-description">A while ago, Node.js introduced support for ECMAScript Modules (ESM). ESM is the <strong>standardized</strong> modules implementation that's been built-in to JavaScript. This differs rather significantly from CommonJS (CJS), which is the module system that Node.js has shipped with for over a decade that make them <em>relatively</em> incompatible. <a href="/posts/explicit-esm-in-node-js-with-mjs/" class="post-list-read-more">Continue reading</a></description><article>

        <description class="post-list-description">We're currently approaching GitHub Actions v2 shipping publicly for <em>everyone</em> to use. I'm personally super excited about this because it means I don't need to configure an external service to run my CI â€“ I can slap in some YAML, and I'm off with a cross-platform (!) CI system with multiple versions of Node.js installed. <a href="/posts/an-unintentionally-comprehensive-introduction-to-github-actions-ci/" class="post-list-read-more">Continue reading</a></description></article>
